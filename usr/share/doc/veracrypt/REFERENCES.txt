Requirements for Building VeraCrypt for Linux and Mac OS X:

    GNU Make
    GNU C++ Compiler 4.0 or compatible
    Apple Xcode (Mac OS X only)
    YASM 1.3.0 or newer (Linux only, x86/x64 architecture only)
    pkg-config
    wxWidgets 3.0 shared library and header files installed or wxWidgets 3.0 library source code (available at https://www.wxwidgets.org)
    FUSE library and header files (available at https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse and https://osxfuse.github.io/)

Instructions for Building VeraCrypt for Linux and Mac OS X:

    Change the current directory to the root of the VeraCrypt source code.

    If you have no wxWidgets shared library installed, run the following command to configure the wxWidgets static library for VeraCrypt and to build it:

    $ make WXSTATIC=1 WX_ROOT=/usr/src/wxWidgets wxbuild

    The variable WX_ROOT must point to the location of the source code of the wxWidgets library. Output files will be placed in the './wxrelease/' directory.

    To build VeraCrypt, run the following command:

    $ make

    or if you have no wxWidgets shared library installed:

    $ make WXSTATIC=1

    If successful, the VeraCrypt executable should be located in the directory 'Main'.

By default, a universal executable supporting both graphical and text user interface (through the switch --text) is built. On Linux, a console-only executable, which requires no GUI library, can be built using the 'NOGUI' parameter:

$ make NOGUI=1 WXSTATIC=1 WX_ROOT=/usr/src/wxWidgets wxbuild $ make NOGUI=1 WXSTATIC=1

On MacOSX, building a console-only executable is not supported.

III. FreeBSD

FreeBSD is supported starting from version 11. The build requirements and instructions are the same as Linux except that gmake should be used instead of make.
